= SortableElementForNestedSet

Sorting a tree using the script.aculo.us helper that comes with Rails is nice.
But if your tree is backed by a nested set, the default request parameter sent to 
your controllers might not really fit your needs. 

This plugin allows you to easily find out which html element was moved (dragged) and
between which two elements it ended up. 

Your work will be to make the update to your nested set model.
